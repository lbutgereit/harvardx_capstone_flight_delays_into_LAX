Predicting domestic flight delays into LAX airport

To the course adjudicator:

Please run the Butgereit-script.R before you try to regenerate the pdf file.

There was one library constraint that I could not get right on Butgereit-script.Rmd.  Perhaps you can email me and tell me how to do it.

I had to use the bookdown library (to get pdf_document2) in the header of Butgereit-script.Rmd..  But that seemed to execute before the install.packages statements.

So I just put the download for bookdown and imager in the Butgereit-script.R file.

Thank you for your consideration
